# Import Sleek-UI and test api fetch in electron


## Setting up the project

- Clone the repository
- Install the dependencies
  ```
  $ npm install
  ```
- Start the Electron App.
  ```
  $ npm start
  ```

This will start the client app via [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) on port 3000 and the electron app which loads `http://localhost:3000` on load.
